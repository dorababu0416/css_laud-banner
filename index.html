            		<h3>Rebel Poet</h3>
            		<p>Kazi Nazrul Islam is the national poet of Bangladesh who is especially recognised as Bidrohi Kobi(Rebel Poet) around the country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician, philantropist os Bangladesh. Through literature, journalism and political activism, Nazrul fought against foreign rule, communalis, imperialism, colonialis, fundamentalism and exploitation. In response, the British colonial government proscribed his books and newspapers and put him behind bars. Through his written Rajbandir Jabanbandi (a political prisonerâ€™s deposition) and his 40-day hunger strike, Nazrul protested against the harassment.</p>

            		<h3>Awesome Writer</h3>
            		<p>Nazrul used subjects and vocabulary never used in Bangla poetry before.He became immensely popular for portraying in his poems contemporary political and social phenomenon. Some fundamental conflicts of human civilisation also formed the themes of his poems. Singularly non-communal, Nazrul drew upon his mixed Hindu and Muslim cultural traditions. He used Sanskrit and Arabic metres as easily as he did traditional Bangla ones. He referred to Persian archetypes with as much ease as he did ancient Hindu ones.</p>
